We show that this form of representation does take place on salient issues when the theory's two fundamental conditions are fulfilled simultaneously. First, legislators must think of themselves as delegates. Second, constituencies must provide consistent cues regarding district preferences to their representatives. The absence of either or both conditions seriously disrupts delegated representation.},

  abstract   = {I examine whether stock ownership by politicians helps to enforce noncontractible quid pro quo relations with firms. The ownership by US Congress members in firms contributing to their election campaigns is higher than in noncontributors. This bias toward contributors depends on the financial incentives of politicians and the relation's value. Firms with a stronger ownership--contribution association receive more government contracts. The financial gains from these contracts are economically large. When politicians divest stocks, firms discontinue contributions to the politicians, lose future contracts, and perform poorly. Politicians divest the stocks in contributors, but not in noncontributors, in anticipation of retirement.},

@article{metalearner,
  abstract   = {There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms---such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks---to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.},

As prominent participants in the government decision making process, U.S. Senators are likely to have knowledge of forthcoming government actions before the information becomes public. This could provide them with an informational advantage over other investors. We test for abnormal returns from the common stock investments of members of the U.S. Senate during the period 1993-1998. We document that a portfolio that mimics the purchases of U.S. Senators beats the market by 85 basis points per month, while a portfolio that mimics the sales of Senators lags the market by 12 basis points per month. The large difference in the returns of stocks bought and sold (nearly one percentage point per month) is economically large and reliably positive.},

  abstract   = {The backpropagation learning method has opened a way to wide applications of neural network research. It is a type of the stochastic descent method known in the sixties. The present paper reviews the wide applicability of the stochastic gradient descent method to various types of models and loss functions. In particular, we apply it to the pattern recognition problem, obtaining a new learning algorithm based on the information criterion. Dynamical properties of learning curves are then studied based on an old paper by the author where the stochastic descent method was proposed for general multilayer networks. The paper is concluded with a short section offering some historical remarks.},

  abstract  = {Equilibria are identified for a three-person game theoretic model of a legislature in which two heterogeneous committee members have superior information (vis-à-vis the legislature) about the consequences of policies that fall in their committee's jurisdiction. Equilibria associated with open, modified, and closed rules are each assessed in terms of distributional benefits (which legislators win and at whose expense) and informational efficiency (how much information becomes available in the course of decision making). While the closed rule tends to confer distributional benefits to the proposing committee member at the direct expense of other legislators, the informational efficiency of the closed rule is greater than that for open and modified rules. The findings have implications for the choice of rules governing the consideration of committee's proposals and for the composition of specialized standing committees.},

  abstract  = {Political scientists often find themselves analyzing data sets with a large number of observations, a large number of variables, or both. Yet, traditional statistical techniques fail to take full advantage of the opportunities inherent in "big data," as they are too rigid to recover nonlinearities and do not facilitate the easy exploration of interactions in high-dimensional data sets. In this article, we introduce a family of tree-based nonparametric techniques that may, in some circumstances, be more appropriate than traditional methods for confronting these data challenges. In particular, tree models are very effective for detecting nonlinearities and interactions, even in data sets with many (potentially irrelevant) covariates. We introduce the basic logic of tree-based models, provide an overview of the most prominent methods in the literature, and conduct three analyses that illustrate how the methods can be implemented while highlighting both their advantages and limitations.},

  abstract = {{Declining response rates and increasing costs have led to greater use of non-probability samples in election polling. But non-probability samples may suffer from selection bias due to differential access, degrees of interest and other factors. Here we estimate voting preference for 19 elections in the US 2014 midterm elections by using large non-probability surveys obtained from SurveyMonkey users, calibrated to estimated control totals using model-assisted calibration combined with adaptive LASSO regression, or the estimated controlled LASSO, ECLASSO. Comparing the bias and root-mean-square error of ECLASSO with traditional calibration methods shows that ECLASSO can be a powerful method for adjusting non-probability surveys even when only a small sample is available from a probability survey. The methodology proposed has potentially broad application across social science and health research, as response rates for probability samples decline and access to non-probability samples increases.}},
